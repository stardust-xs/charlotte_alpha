"""
The inquiry module: Provides functions while inquiring on command line.

These functions are based of `questionary` module but provides more
custom use of the same. This module should be used on command line only
otherwise, it will raise an Exception.

At a glance, the structure of the module is following:
 - confirm():           Asks for confirmation. Provides Yes or No
                        options to confirm. It is recommended to use
                        this function by assigning it to a variable and
                        then the variable should be used in an if-else
                        condition to invoke the action.
 - answer():            Answers the asked question. It is recommended to
                        use this function while taking inputs. If
                        `secure` arg is made True, it masks the response
                        with `*` just like the password field in HTML.
 - decide():            Provides choice & then asks answer based on the
                        choosed option.
 - choose():            Provides options to choose from. These options
                        are then to be used for further code execution.
                        It is recommended to use this function when any
                        one of multiple options needs to be selected.
 - select_file():       Provides list of files to choose from directory.

#   History:
#
#   < Checkout my GitHub repo for history and latest stable build >
#
#   2.0.0 - Reworked script.
#           Merged `secure` function with `answer` function.
#   1.1.1 - Improved the type hints by using the typing module.
#           Made the code more* PEP-8 compliant.
#   1.0.2 - Synced all updates in history as other files.
#           Reduced unnecessary use of "`" in comments for simplicity.
#           Added new function, `select_file` to select a file from the
#           directory.
#   1.0.1 - Removed general questionary imports.
#           Added `choose` function to substitute the `select` from
#           questionary module and updated main docstring accordingly.
#   1.0.0 - First code.
